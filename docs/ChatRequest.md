# ChatRequest


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model** | **str** | The model to use. Currently only llama-2-7b-chat is supported, however, more models are planned. Stay tuned! ðŸ‘€ | [optional] 
**chats** | **List[List[ChatRequestChatsInnerInner]]** | An array of chats, where each chat may have multiple messages. To optimize efficiency, it&#39;s recommended that you batch these chats into a single request whenever possible. Additionally, when structuring these conversations, it&#39;s required that the first and last messages are from the user and that they alternate between the user and the assistant. | [optional] 
**temperature** | **float** | This parameter controls the level of randomness and creativity in the generated text. A higher temperature value will produce more unique and unpredictable responses, while a lower temperature will produce more repetitive and predictable responses. The default temperature value is set to 0.6. However, depending on your specific use case, you may need to experiment with different temperature values. For instance, a higher temperature value might be more appropriate if you&#39;re looking for more creative and diverse responses. On the other hand, if you require more structured and predictable responses, a lower temperature value may be more suitable. | [optional] [default to 0.6]

## Example

```python
from deep_api.models.chat_request import ChatRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ChatRequest from a JSON string
chat_request_instance = ChatRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ChatRequest.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
chat_request_dict = chat_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ChatRequest from a dict
chat_request_form_dict = chat_request.from_dict(chat_request_dict)
```
